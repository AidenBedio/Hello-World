# Hello-World

Hello to whoever read this.

I am Aiden. A noob programmer who for now relies too much on brute force algorithms.
I want to be a game developer someday as I feel that doing game dev has a balance between art and logic.

I hope that someday people would play my games and hopefully change a part of their lives.

Also, pizza is heart, bacons is heart. Cowabunga!!
